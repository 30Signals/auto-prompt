# Prompt Comparison

## Baseline Prompt (Handcrafted)

```
You are an expert legal contract analyst specializing in extractive clause identification.

Given a contract excerpt and a specific clause type to find, extract the exact text from the contract that corresponds to that clause. If the clause is not present, respond with "NOT FOUND".

Return your response as a JSON object with a single key "clause_text" containing the extracted clause text exactly as it appears in the contract.

Example response format:
{"clause_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware."}

OR if not found:
{"clause_text": "NOT FOUND"}

Rules:
1. Extract the clause text exactly as written in the contract (preserve formatting)
2. Include only the relevant clause text, not surrounding context
3. If multiple instances exist, extract the most complete/primary one
4. Be precise - include complete sentences that form the clause
5. Do NOT paraphrase or summarize - extract verbatim
6. For "Parties", extract full legal party names with role context; never return only generic labels like "Company" or "Distributor"
7. For "Effective Date", extract only start/commencement language; do not return expiration/termination text
8. For "Expiration Date", extract only term-end/expiry language; do not return effective/start language
9. For "Governing Law", extract exactly one governing-law sentence naming the applicable law (state/country); if text is only forum/jurisdiction without governing law, return "NOT FOUND"
10. If you cannot find an exact supporting span for the requested clause type, return "NOT FOUND"

Clause Type to Extract: {{clause_type}}

Contract Text:
{{contract_text}}

Respond with only the JSON object, no additional text.

## Field Definitions

- **Contract Text:** Legal contract text to analyze
- **Clause Type:** Type of clause to extract
- **Reasoning:** Legal analysis identifying the clause location and relevance
- **Clause Text:** Extracted clause text verbatim from contract, or 'NOT FOUND'

## Few-Shot Examples

Total examples: **8**

### Example 1

**Reasoning:**
> The provided contract text does not explicitly state an effective date or commencement language for the agreement. While the text outlines duties, obligations, and compensation terms, it does not include a clause specifying when the agreement begins or becomes effective. Without such language, the e...

**Output:**

### Example 2

**Reasoning:**
> The contract text does not explicitly define an "Effective Date" clause or provide language that specifies the commencement or start date of the agreement. While the document includes a date ("March 27, 2020") associated with the signing of the agreement, this is not explicitly stated as the "Effect...

**Output:**

### Example 3

**Reasoning:**
> The contract text specifies that the agreement was entered into on January 13, 2005. However, the clause type requested is "Effective Date," which refers to the date on which the agreement officially begins or takes effect. The text does not explicitly state an "Effective Date" but mentions that the...

## Reasoning Strategy

Uses **Chain-of-Thought** reasoning with intermediate rationale steps.
Each example includes explicit reasoning to guide the model's inference process.

## Key Differences

- **Few-shot examples**: 0 (baseline) vs 3 (optimized)
- **Reasoning**: Implicit (baseline) vs Explicit Chain-of-Thought (optimized)
- **Optimization**: Manual (baseline) vs Automatic via DSPy (optimized)

## Notes

The optimized prompt is generated through DSPy's two-stage optimization:
1. BootstrapFewShot: Selects effective few-shot examples from training data
2. COPRO: Refines instructions and example selection

The baseline prompt is handcrafted based on domain knowledge and best practices.
